## What do you see instead?

## Log file of the issue/error

## /version output?

<!-- Please note that _WITHOUT_ the specific version output your issue _WILL BE IGNORED_ -->
<!-- A /version output looks like this: This server is running CraftBukkit version git-Spigot-06f33d0-86fdf92 (MC: 1.12.2) (Implementing API version 1.12.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT) -->

<!-- Adding e.g. only 1.12.2 will lead _IGNORED ISSUES_ -->

## SilkSpawners version

<!-- _LATEST_ is _NOT_ a valid version -->

## Please provide any additional information below.
